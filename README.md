# Downloadify

## Approach

This library uses some methods from SWF Object to create and download a file. IT also requires a static image file for it's four states. Interesting.

## Test code
https://github.com/gjudki/csv-dl-test
branch: 'downloadify'

## Browser support

This doesn't appear to work in ANY commonly used browser.

## Drawbacks
- It doesn't work. Did I implement it wrong? Maybe.
- This project hasn't been updated for 7 years. A lot of things have changed in the last 7 years.
- Not very highly adopted

## Conclusion

This was a giant waste of time, but I am glad I tried. I think it was a well intentioned solution for a problem that has plagued web designers for a long time (and still does), but for whatever reason, it doesn't work anymore. Sad.
